# Clicky-Game
For this assignment, you'll create a memory game with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

* Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.

* The application should keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

* Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.

## Deployment

## Built With
